For some time now I've had the urge to write a few posts about small projects I
have worked on in the past. It's just stuff I do for fun like
[bash-reduce](https://github.com/sorhus/bash-reduce),
[hmmongo](https://github.com/sorhus/hmmongo) and maybe even
[user-journey-analysis](https://github.com/sorhus/user-journey-analysis)

I might write or rant about other things too, like silly arguments about daylight
savings time or whatever. Let's see what happens.
